# 100 Days Challenge Template
A template to help you create your own custom tracker printout for 100 days challenge. But it can also be customized for shorter challenges, such as 30 or 21 days challenges.

The main faitures are a big overview for the complete challenge which you can colour in according to how much of it you've already done. 
There is a little goal overview because from my own experience, for a long challenges, it makes sense to have sub-goals or maybe also define rewards. 

Then there are smaller trackers including space for you to note down what you acutally did (like how much time was spent, on what dates in case you don't do it daily, what you did, etc.) and what you have learned. Because I have realized that it can feel pretty meaningless if you only Tweet because Tweets get lost and looking back, you might want to review what you even did and what you learned as a takeaway. So I suggest you make some notes on that.
